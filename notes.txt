fixing tht godforsaken bug 
i need to now allow deleting of posts, and handle any issues that may cause with shares / replies etc





// todo



-- finish delete modal
-- maybr make shared by / replying to username blue ?





-- maybe have a no posts to show message on empty feed ?

-- limit post length in news feed. make them view the full comment if th post is too long



-- after view posts and delete posts, need to handle sharing / replying to deleted posts
   and handle the comment button number + active style

-- refactor post modal into its own component

- client and server side validation
- seperate rest api
