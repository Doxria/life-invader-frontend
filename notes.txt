// ideas







get rid of side bar post button. this will be a nightmare to hook up with all the different post
  / get post functions of each page. instead have a make post area at top of profile page.




// just finnished

right side bar. (store link + follow suggestions). few ui tweaks.
loading page spinner
welcome message on empty feed

















// todo`



need to refactor db queries to use async.parallel (promise.all ?)


-- pagination / infinite scroll

custom main scroll bar




-- limit post length in news feed. make them view the full comment if th post is too long










// features

- fully mobile responsive
- client and server side validation
- seperate rest api
