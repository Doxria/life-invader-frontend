// ideas


allow 5 comments and then require lifeinvader premium or extra liveinvader coins ?


custom main scroll bar

put mobile nav at bottom of screen


admin user (me) can delete any post / account

on empty news feed  (new account) have link to search page and a few recomended ppl to follow

get rid of side bar post button. this will be a nightmare to hook up with all the different post
  / get post functions of each page. instead have a make post area at top of profile page.




// just finnished

profile descriptions + move post time stamp + add post form to profile






need to add shop / shop logic

need to refactor db queries to use async.parallel (promise.all ?)








// todo`





-- pagination / infinite scroll

-- maybe have a no posts to show message on empty feed ?

-- limit post length in news feed. make them view the full comment if th post is too long

-- make loading page / component look better








today i will get pin working and re do the pin / delete icon.
search page
profile description & profile add post area











// features

- fully mobile responsive
- client and server side validation
