// ideas


allow 5 comments and then require lifeinvader premium or extra liveinvader coins ?


custom main scroll bar

admin user (me) can delete any post / account

on empty news feed  (new account) have link to search page and a few recomended ppl to follow

get rid of side bar post button. this will be a nightmare to hook up with all the different post
  / get post functions of each page. instead have a make post area at top of profile page.




// just finnished

store
















// todo`



need to refactor db queries to use async.parallel (promise.all ?)


-- pagination / infinite scroll

-- maybe have a no posts to show message on empty feed ?

-- limit post length in news feed. make them view the full comment if th post is too long

-- make loading page / component look better

-- right sidebar(link to store  suggestions freinds) 







// features

- fully mobile responsive
- client and server side validation
- seperate rest api
