Use modals for register and log in ?

allow 5 comments and then require lifeinvader premium or extra liveinvader coins ?

have made up adds ?

on register, have a no data collection button that cant be checked, moves around etc. ?

toast message on successfull registration and reply?




// just finnished

making the subject of the view post page big, and displaying replies oldest to newest underneath.
i need to now allow deleting of posts, and handle any issues that may cause with shares / replies etc





// todo

-- maybe have a no posts to show message on empty feed ?

-- limit post length in news feed. make them view the full comment if th post is too long



-- after view posts and delete posts, need to handle sharing / replying to deleted posts
   and handle the comment button number + active style

-- refactor post modal into its own component



















// features

- fully mobile responsive
- client and server side validation
- seperate rest api
