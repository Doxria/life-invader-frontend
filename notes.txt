// ideas

Use modals for register and log in ?

allow 5 comments and then require lifeinvader premium or extra liveinvader coins ?

have made up adds ?

on register, have a no data collection button that cant be checked, moves around etc. ?

toast message on successfull registration ?




// just finnished

refactoring post component to not use state, and instead refresh the posts array
which grabs teh data from server again. this saved a lot of headaches and made my code a lot more simple




// todo

-- change post icon hover to the active styles

-- maybe have a no posts to show message on empty feed ?

-- new lines are not preserved in submited post

-- change mobile dropdown so that it is all in the main nave but with overflow hidden, then
   the nav just grows down on click














// features

- fully mobile responsive
- client and server side validation
- seperate rest api
