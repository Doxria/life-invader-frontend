Use modals for register and log in ?

allow 5 comments and then require lifeinvader premium or extra liveinvader coins ?

have made up adds ?

on register, have a no data collection button that cant be checked, moves around etc. ?

toast message on successfull registration ?




// just finnished

refactoring post component to not use state, and instead refresh the posts array
which grabs teh data from server again. this saved a lot of headaches and made my code a lot more simple




// todo

-- maybe have a no posts to show message on empty feed ?




-- limit post length in news feed. make them view the full comment if th post is too long

-- add the same modal scroll to the side bars. make the top and bottom margin responsive so it is the 
   matches whatever screen size it is

-- custom scroll bars ?
















// features
