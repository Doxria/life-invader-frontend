toast message on successfull registration and reply?

custom main scroll bar


admin user (me) can delete any post / account

on empty news feed  (new account) have link to search page and a few recomended ppl to follow

get rid of side bar post button. this will be a nightmare to hook up with all the different post
  / get post functions of each page. instead have a make post area at top of profile page.

allow images on posts?

followers / following page
only showing posts from user we are following

this introduced a bug where you cant see posts on a profile page unless you are following them
and if you are following them you see all posts by everyone
