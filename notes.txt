fixing tht second godforsaken bug 
i need to now allow deleting of posts, and handle any issues that may cause with shares / replies etc.
the delete button just logs the id of the post. i have put the delete function into a contained util file.





// todo



-- finish delete functionality

-- mayve change the bin icon to a cross

-- maybe have a no posts to show message on empty feed ?

-- limit post length in news feed. make them view the full comment if th post is too long

--  need to handle sharing / replying to deleted posts
   and handle the comment button number + active style

- client and server side validation
- seperate rest api
