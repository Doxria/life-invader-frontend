toast message on successfull registration and reply?




// just finnished

fixing tht second godforsaken bug 
i need to now allow deleting of posts, and handle any issues that may cause with shares / replies etc.
the delete button just logs the id of the post. i have put the delete function into a contained util file.





// todo



-- finish delete functionality

-- refactor new post function into a seperate utility file, like how im doing the delete post
-- refactor makeing post on home page to funtino liek the other new posts. ie dont prepend to state 
   and instead just reload. this will be slower but allow me to use the create post modal in home and 
   seperate out the make post function into utils


-- mayve change the bin icon to a cross





-- maybe have a no posts to show message on empty feed ?

-- limit post length in news feed. make them view the full comment if th post is too long



--  need to handle sharing / replying to deleted posts
   and handle the comment button number + active style

-- refactor post modal into its own component
